          <h1>About Korean Culture</h1>
          <p>Korea’s heritage features a remarkable uniqueness in its history, art, music, and lifestyle as it is a rich combination of culture and modernization. Although it is deeply engrained in the Confucian notion of respect for the elderly and families, it still welcomes the outside world.</p>

          <h2>Hanbok: Traditional Korean Attire</h2>
          <p>The hanbok is the recognized clothing of Korea that is appreciated for its beauty and stylized shapes. It consists of a bright, draped jacket (jeogori) along with a blouse (chima) worn high on the waist for females, and pants (baji) for males. Hanbok is still worn during festivities, marriages and important holidays like Chuseok (Harvest Festival) and Seollal also known as Lunar New Year. The colors and motifs of the clothes serve to define the social class or the relation of the owner of a garment.</p>

          <h2>Traditonal Korean Game</h2>
          <p>Games from Korea’s history capture the communal aspect and creativity of its people. One of them is considered the most recognizable, Yutnori, which is centered on four thin wooden sticks. Another one is Jegichagi, almost a Korean hacky sack game, in which a jegie is kicked up and caught without it hitting the ground. During holidays, one can also notice other games and activities such as Tuho (throwing of sticks into any narrow holes) or Yeon Nalligi which is kite flying during winter seasons.</p>

        <h2>Traditional Korean Dance</h2>
        <p>That’s a great move! Asking to call shows that you’re interested in spending time with her, even if it’s just through conversation. It’s a nice way to connect more deeply, especially when working on assignments or staying up late.

          How did she respond to your request? Did she seem open to the idea? If she agrees to call, you can use the opportunity to keep the vibe light and fun while also supporting each other with work. If she’s hesitant, don’t take it personally it could be due to being tired, distracted, or just needing some space.</p>
